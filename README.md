## objls

This is a command line tool to browse the Windows Object Namespace. I created it to look at the namespace inside and outside of Windows containers to study and learn more about the isolation of Windows containers. There is an internal tool called objdir at Microsoft, it used to be part of the WDK but no longer is, so I've created this as a replacement.
